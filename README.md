# Cracking_Passwords

As part of the course Internet Security and Privacy, we were asked to crack passwords leaked by three companies - Yahoo, LinkedIn, and Formspring.

In this Assignment, I explored several strategies and was able to crack 454492, 80561, and 1766 passwords respectively.

Please feel free to take a look at the report and the code to understand my approach.
